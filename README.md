## üìÅ Projects

### üîπ Project 1: Mosaic Blur Filter (C++ with CMake)

**Folder:** `Project_1_Mosaic/CMakeProject1`

- A C++ application that applies a mosaic blur effect to an input image.
- Built using CMake and Visual Studio.
- Demonstrates low-level image manipulation and file I/O.
- Input images must be placed in the same directory as the built executable before running.

---

### üîπ Project 2: Image Compression with K-Means (Python)

**Folder:** `Project_2_Kmeans`

- A Python program that implements **K-means clustering from scratch** to compress images by reducing color palette.
- Includes test images (`test1.jpg` through `test5.jpg`) used during development.
- Demonstrates algorithm implementation, pixel-level processing, and image visualization using `matplotlib`.

### üîπ Project 3: 2D Slingshot Game (Unity, C#)

**Folder:** `Project_3_Slingshot`

- A Unity 2D game inspired by **Angry Birds**, built with Unity‚Äôs physics engine.
- Implements slingshot mechanics, projectile physics, and simple object interactions.
- Scripts are written in C# using Unity‚Äôs MonoBehaviour system.

> ‚úÖ To run: Open the folder in Unity Editor (`Unity Hub > Add Project`), and press **Play** in the Unity editor.

## üõ† Technologies Used

- C++, CMake, Visual Studio
- Python (with `PIL`, `NumPy`, `matplotlib`)
- Unity, C#, Unity Physics
- Git & GitHub for version control

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Build outputs (e.g., `.exe`, `.obj`, `.pdb`, `Library/`, etc.) are ignored using `.gitignore` to keep the repo clean.
- Projects are organized for clarity and version tracking, not deployment.
